# Sneaker Panel Pro  
### Professional Footwear Design Toolkit for Blender

Sneaker Panel Pro is a professional-grade Blender add-on that streamlines the creation, flattening, and projection of footwear panels â€” designed specifically for product and footwear designers who work with Blender's advanced modeling and Geometry Nodes system.

Built from real footwear design workflows, Sneaker Panel Pro allows you to design, project, and visualize upper panel constructions directly on your 3D shoe last â€” bridging the gap between concept and production-ready patterning.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- **Panel Projection System**  
  Draw or import 2D panel shapes and project them accurately onto complex 3D surfaces using raycast or UV-based projection.

- **Grease Pencil to Panel Workflow**  
  Convert Grease Pencil strokes directly into editable panels. Flatten, fill, and reproject your drawn shapes seamlessly.

- **UV Flattening & Reprojection**  
  Automatically flatten surface geometry to UV space for precision editing and easy pattern transfers.

- **Panel Wrap Automation**  
  Generate perfectly conformed overlays from flat mesh shapes using dual-raycast projection logic.

- **Lace Generator (Experimental)**  
  Quickly add realistic lacing patterns using procedural geometry nodes for rapid concept visualization.

- **Fully Modular Design**  
  Each tool can be used independently or combined into a unified workflow. Ideal for footwear, fashion, and accessory prototyping.

## ðŸ§  Basic Workflow Overview

### **1. Flatten to UV**
Convert selected 3D panels into flattened 2D geometry using the built-in UV flattening operator.

### **2. Fill and Edit**
Use Blenderâ€™s native modeling tools to modify the flattened panels â€” perfect for stitching, perforations, or logo placements.

### **3. Project Back to Surface**
Reproject your edited panels back onto the 3D shell using either UV or Raycast projection for high-fidelity curvature matching.

### **4. Finalize and Export**
Apply solidify, bevel, and stitching geometry modifiers, then export for rendering, visualization, or 3D printing.
