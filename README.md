# Sneaker Panel Pro  
### Professional Footwear Design Toolkit for Blender

**Sneaker Panel Pro** is a professional-grade Blender add-on that streamlines the creation of 3D footwear panels — designed specifically for product and footwear designers who work with Blender’s advanced modeling and Geometry Nodes system.

Built from real footwear design workflows, Sneaker Panel Pro lets you design, project, and visualize upper-panel constructions directly on your 3D shoe last — bridging the gap between concept and production-ready patterning.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Panel Projection System**  
  Draw or import 2D panel shapes and project them accurately onto complex 3D surfaces using raycast or UV-based projection.

- **Grease Pencil → Panel Workflow**  
  Convert Grease Pencil strokes directly into editable panels. Flatten, fill, and re-project your drawn shapes seamlessly.

- **UV Flattening & Reprojection**  
  Automatically flatten surface geometry to UV space for precision editing and easy pattern transfers.

- **Panel Wrap Automation**  
  Generate perfectly conformed overlays from flat mesh shapes using dual-raycast projection logic.

- **Lace Generator (Experimental)**  
  Quickly add realistic lacing patterns using procedural Geometry Nodes for rapid concept visualization.

- **Fully Modular Design**  
  Each tool can be used independently or combined into a unified workflow — ideal for footwear, fashion, and accessory prototyping.

| Required Add-on | Where to Enable | Purpose |
|-----------------|----------------|----------|
| **Grease Pencil to Curves** | *Edit → Preferences → Add-ons → Search “Grease Pencil to Curves” → Enable* | Converts Grease Pencil strokes to editable curves for panel generation. |

**Optional but Recommended**
- **Node Wrangler** — useful for inspecting and editing Geometry Nodes networks.

## 🧠 Basic Workflow Overview

### **1 – Auto UV**
Use the *Auto UV* tool to unwrap your shell and generate a UV map.

### **2 – Reference Projection**
Convert your 2D line art into a material and project it onto the shell mesh.  
Use this as a guide to trace original designs precisely.

### **3 – Panel Creation Methods**

#### a. Surface Workflow (3D)  
Draw directly on your shell with Grease Pencil, convert to curves, and generate panels instantly.

#### b. UV Workflow (2D)  
Work in UV space — sketch, fill, and project panels back onto the 3D model for precision patterning.

### **4 – Finalize and Export**
Apply *Solidify Panel* for thickness, use the *Lace Generator* for lacing geometry, and export for rendering, visualization, or 3D printing.
