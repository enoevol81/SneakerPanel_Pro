Sneaker Panel Pro is a modular Blender add-on designed for rapid creation of sneaker panel geometry directly on 3D surfaces. It enables footwear designers and 3D artists to sketch panel outlines using the Grease Pencil, convert them to editable curves, generate mesh panels, flatten them with accurate UV mapping, and re-project the geometry back onto the 3D sneaker shell for finalization.

The plugin includes:

Surface-Based Drawing: Intuitive Grease Pencil tools stabilized for smooth sketching on 3D models.

Curve & Mesh Conversion: Automated workflows for converting drawings to editable curves and mesh with smoothing and merging.

UV Flattening: Accurate barycentric projection of mesh panels to 2D UV space.

Reprojection System: Geometry Nodes-based system for projecting UV-flattened panels back to the original shell mesh with adjustable offset and scaling.

Modular Architecture: Designed for extensibility, with separate modules for drawing, conversion, flattening, and finalization.

Current development priorities include completing the "Bezier to Surface", "Shell UV Curves to Panel", and "Solidify Panel" modules, and integrating all UI panels into a unified sidebar interface.
